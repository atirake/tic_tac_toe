write a program that:

Prints an empty grid at the beginning of the game.
Creates a game loop where the program asks the user to enter the cell coordinates, analyzes the move for correctness and shows a grid with the changes if everything is okay.
Ends the game when someone wins or there is a draw.
You need to output the final result at the end of the game.
